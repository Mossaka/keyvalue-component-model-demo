# Key-Value Component Demo

This repo serves as an example of how to use the latest wasm runtime [wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime) and its component-model feature to build and execute a wasm component. The wasm component uses the key-value interface to interface with a in-memory key-value store provided by the host runtime. The interface is written in WIT file. The binding to the wasm component types is generated by the [wit-bindgen](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen) tool.

## Build

To build the wasm component, run the following command:

```bash
cd ./guest
cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasi
```

After running the above command, the guest wasm module will be generated at `./guest/target/wasm32-wasi/release/guest.wasm`. This is not a wasm component yet. We can use a tool called [wasm-tools](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools) to convert the wasm module to a wasm component.

```bash
wasm-tools component new /
./guest/target/wasm32-wasi/release/guest.wasm -o ./target/guest.component.wasm
```

The above command will generate a wasm component at `./target/guest.component.wasm`.

> Note: As of now, the component-model feature in wasmtime does not support `wasi_snapshot_preview1` yet. This means that the wasm component cannot be executed by the host that embeds wasmtime because the component's WASI imports are not provided by the host.

### Workaround

This repo provides a wasm component that implements a subset of `wasi_snapshot_preview1` ABI. The wasi component can be built by running the following command:

```bash
cd ./wasi_snapshot_preview1
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Notice that the above command uses the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` triple instead of `wasm32-wasi`. 

After building the wasi component, we can use the adapter feature of `wasm-tools component` to convert the wasm module to a wasm component that implements the required WASI ABI:

```bash
wasm-tools component new /
./guest/target/wasm32-wasi/release/guest.wasm -o ./target/guest.component.wasm /
--adapter ./wasi_snapshot_preview1/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/wasi_snapshot_preview1.wasm
```

Now, the `./target/guest.component.wasm` is the desired wasm component that ready to be executed by the host.

## Run

The following command will run the wasm component in the host:

```bash
cargo run
```

If everything goes well, you will see the following output:
```
     Running `target/debug/host`
res from guest: world

res from host: "world"
```
